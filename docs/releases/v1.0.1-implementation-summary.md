# PivotPHP v1.0.1 - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Regex Route Support ✅
- Advanced pattern matching with constraints
- Predefined shortcuts (int, slug, uuid, date, etc.)
- Full regex blocks for complex patterns
- Backward compatibility with existing routes

### 2. PSR-7 Dual Version Support ✅
- **Automatic Version Detection**: `Psr7VersionDetector` class
- **Version Switching Script**: `scripts/switch-psr7-version.php`
- **Full Compatibility**: Works with both PSR-7 v1.x and v2.x
- **ReactPHP Ready**: Can integrate with ReactPHP when using v1.x

### 3. Code Quality Improvements ✅
- Refactored `RouteCache::compilePattern()` into 12 helper methods
- Extracted duplicated route matching logic into shared helper
- Comprehensive documentation for complex regex patterns
- PHPStan Level 9 compliance maintained
- PSR-12 code style compliance

## How PSR-7 Dual Support Works

1. **Detection**:
   ```php
   use PivotPHP\Core\Http\Psr7\Factory\Psr7VersionDetector;
   
   $version = Psr7VersionDetector::getVersion(); // "1.x" or "2.x"
   ```

2. **Switching Versions**:
   ```bash
   # Switch to PSR-7 v1.x (for ReactPHP)
   php scripts/switch-psr7-version.php 1
   composer update psr/http-message
   
   # Switch to PSR-7 v2.x (for modern projects)
   php scripts/switch-psr7-version.php 2
   composer update psr/http-message
   ```

3. **Current State**: 
   - Currently configured for PSR-7 v1.x
   - All tests pass (315 tests, 1654 assertions)
   - PHPStan Level 9 compliant

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/Http/Psr7/Factory/Psr7VersionDetector.php`
- `src/Http/Psr7/Psr7V1CompatibilityTrait.php`
- `scripts/switch-psr7-version.php`
- `scripts/adapt-psr7-v1.php`
- `docs/technical/compatibility/psr7-versions.md`
- `docs/technical/compatibility/psr7-dual-support.md`
- `docs/technical/http/README.md`
- `docs/releases/v1.0.1-psr7-compatibility-status.md`
- `docs/releases/v1.0.1-implementation-summary.md`

### Modified Files:
- All PSR-7 implementation files (removed/added return types)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (updated with v1.0.1 changes)
- `docs/releases/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW_v1.0.1.md`
- `composer.json` (PSR-7 constraint)

## Testing

Both PSR-7 versions have been tested:
- ✅ Tests pass with PSR-7 v1.x
- ✅ Tests pass with PSR-7 v2.x (when switched)
- ✅ PHPStan Level 9 passes with both versions
- ✅ PSR-12 compliance maintained

## Usage Examples

### With ReactPHP (PSR-7 v1.x):
```php
// After switching to PSR-7 v1.x
$app = new Application();
$app->get('/api/users', function ($req, $res) {
    return $res->json(['users' => ['John', 'Jane']]);
});

// Now compatible with ReactPHP!
```

### With Modern Packages (PSR-7 v2.x):
```php
// After switching to PSR-7 v2.x
$app = new Application();
// Full type safety with return types
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can choose PSR-7 version based on their ecosystem
2. **Compatibility**: Enables integration with libraries like ReactPHP
3. **Type Safety**: Maintains type information through PHPDoc when using v1.x
4. **Easy Migration**: Simple script to switch between versions

## Limitations

1. Cannot use both versions simultaneously
2. Requires running script and updating dependencies to switch
3. Custom extensions may need updates when switching

## Next Steps

1. Document the dual support in main README
2. Add CI tests for both PSR-7 versions
3. Consider separate packages for v1.x and v2.x in future
4. Create examples for ReactPHP integration
